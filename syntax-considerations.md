# Summary
[summary]: #summary

A collection of considerations for syntax design decisions.  This is an early draft; many changes are expected, both in amount of content and organization of information.


# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

To facilitate the discussion around syntactic principles by providing a record of considerations that have been brought up.  The intent is to be usable both as a checklist to help in discussing specific proposals and also as a starting point for developing and refining principles in the future.


# Considerations List
[considerations-list]: #considerations-list

* familiar expectations
  * infix operators
  * algebra-style function notation
  * parens can be used for grouping
* flexible
* clean / not "noisy"
* dependent on advanced tooling/editor support
* easy to rearrange chunks of code
* distinctive
* tree resemblance
* uniformity vs texture


# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

Potentially relevant but outside the scope of this document:
* What are the goals of the Racket2 project?  Which barriers we are most interested in lowering may be part of the decision-making process.
* What will be the relationship between Racket2 and the existing #lang racket?


# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

* Define categories of considerations
* Provide guidelines?
* Refine into a discussion framework
